# PrintYourVehicle.com GitHub Organization

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **PrintYourVehicle.com**! Our mission is to revolutionize the process of vehicle and part printing by providing user-friendly, open-source software that integrates seamlessly with various printers, including normal printers, CNC machines, and 3D printers.

## Organization Details

### Mission
Simplify the complex process of creating 3D CAD files, breaking them into manageable pieces ("bucks"), and managing printer workflows for anyone, regardless of their technical expertise.

### Core Projects
1. **PYV-Electron-App**
   - An Electron-based application for managing printer queues, browsing available models, and handling `.pyv` file integration.

2. **PYV-File-Standard**
   - Specification and tools for creating `.pyv` files (packaged `.zip` files containing 3D models and metadata).

3. **PYV-Printer-Integration**
   - Libraries and plugins for integrating common printers (2D, CNC, and 3D).

4. **PYV-Community-Store**
   - A centralized repository for community-created 3D buck files and resources.



## Project Roadmap

### MVP Features
- **File Management**: `.pyv` standard file support for zipping 3D CAD files and metadata.
- **Printer Integration**: Compatibility with normal printers, CNC machines, and 3D printers.
- **User Interface**: Old-school Tally-inspired UI with a modern touch for intuitive navigation.
- **Community Store**: Integration with a repository of downloadable 3D models.

### Future Goals
- **Cloud Synchronization**: Backup `.pyv` files and printer queues to the cloud.
- **AI Assistance**: Integrate local LLMs for real-time design and print recommendations.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Track and optimize printer performance.
